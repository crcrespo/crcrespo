# Hi there! 👋 I'm Cristian

## About Me

I'm a seasoned **Backend Engineer** with a passion for crafting robust and scalable systems. My expertise revolves around building applications using Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. 
I enhance my work by incorporating Kubernetes, embracing CI/CD and a strong DevOps culture. I'm used to work in a high-concurrency environment, using technologies such as ElasticSearch, Redis and RabbitMq.

In addition to my tech background, I offer a unique perspective as a **Mechanical Engineer** and **ADAS Test Driver** with valuable field experience. In my role, I guided and advised clients by analyzing data collected from car sensors, helping in the vehicle's development while adhering to industry regulations like EuroNCAP, NTSHA, and R79. My journey in Mechanical Engineering has equipped me with exceptional problem-solving skills and a keen eye for detail.
